# Dark Tower
A short text-based adventure for the Gamebuino.

You enter the tower of a deceased mage in search of a cure for the curse of undeath that has befallen you.

The game may be lacking in-depth plot and story (I hope that comes as no surprize,) but provides some exploration and puzzle (even if that may be 'what was the author thinking?') It was primarily an experiment with what could be squeezed into a Gamebuino (technically a Makerbuino in my case, but I hope there are no compatibility issues.) Any bug reports are welcome, especially spelling mistakes - given the whole text-based element of the game!

# In-game Controls
D-pad - scroll through the description / navigate though the available actions/items 

A - select an action/item

# Building
